[PyStokes](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pystokes) is a Python library for studying phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions between spherical particles. In particular, the library has been specifically designed for studying these interactions in suspensions of active particles. Such particles are distinguished by their ability to produce flow, and thus motion, in the absence of external forces or torques. Active particles are endowed with a mechanism to produce hydrodynamic flow in a thin interfacial layer, which may be due to the motion of cilia, as in microorganisms (Brennen & Winet, 1977) or osmotic flows of various kinds in response to spontaneously generated gradients of phoretic fields (Ebbens & Howse, 2010). The latter, often called autophoresis as we describe in more detail below.
